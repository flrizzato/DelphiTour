Data-Aware Components
This form uses some of the Raize Data-Aware Components with Custom Framing options to create a dialog box that mimics the appearance of a paper form. 

A TRzFrameController component is used to control the framing options of all components from one location.

The background texture is provided through the TRzBackground component.
