TRzToolButton
The first button on the toolbar is a TRzToolButton with its ToolStyle property set to tsDropDown. Clicking on the arrow displays the associated menu (i.e. a TPopupMenu instance). Clicking on the image invokes the action associated with the button''s OnClick event.

TRzButton & TRzBitBtn
The TRzButton component is functionally equivalent to TButton. However, as a custom VCL control TRzButton also supports multi-line captions, 3D text styles, and custom colors for the button face. The TRzBitBtn descendant adds support for displaying images from bitmap glyphs or image lists. In addition, RC uses a new and improved drawing method to give the buttons a crisp and professional appearance.

TRzCheckBox and TRzRadioButton
Our check boxes and radio buttons support multi-line hints, 3D text styles, and custom glyphs. These components also support a new flat style and Hot Tracking.

TRzMenuButton
As a TRzBtiBtn descendant, a TRzMenuButton provides an easy and concise way to display a popup menu to the user.

Repeating Buttons
This group box contains three components (TRzRapidFireButton, TRzSpinButtons, and TRzSpinner) that repeat their actions as long as the button is held down.

TRzShapeButton
This component creates a button from a specified bitmap image. By specifying transparent regions in the image, nonstandard buttons can easily be created.

TRzDialogButtons
This compound component embeds 3 buttons (Ok, Cancel, and Help), making it extremely easy to create the standard dialog buttons
